## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Zenith, and I make coding videos and projects. I've built some pretty neat tools, like a content safety model for artwork, or graphs of Twitter users and their interactions! Currently, I have been building a model capable of tagging digital artwork and giving suggestions for similar digital artwork!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
  - ASP.NET Core
  - React

## Recent Projects

**Digital Art Content Moderation** ([furry-image-model](https://github.com/ZenithO-o/furry-image-model))

- A project designed to tag artwork and determine safety of content. Is also capable of encoding images into latent vector spaces.

**Twitter Blocker** ([twitter-blocker](https://github.com/ZenithO-o/twitter-blocker))

- Now defunct tool using the Twitter API to block accounts rated to have high animosity toward queer users of the platform.

**GTGuessr**

- A clone of [GeoGuessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/) based off of Georgia Tech campus.


## Future Plans

- Build a service that utilizes my digital art model.
- Make a V2 of my pawgge.rs website to include many of my projects for people to try out!
